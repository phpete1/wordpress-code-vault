save &amp; search for code snippets when building a wordpress admin ui

# about this project
i hate typing repetitive code and trying to remember every piece of code line-by-line.

this plugin will let you save code snippets (like form html, wp_hooks, and really any code you like).

you can reference that code whenever you like.
